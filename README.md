# Selfscan
In this program, the addItem function adds an item to the cart by creating a new Item struct and pushing it onto the end of the cart vector. The printReceipt function prints out the contents of the cart in a nicely formatted receipt, calculating the total price as it goes.

In the main function, the program loops to prompt the user for item names and prices until they enter "done". It then calls printReceipt to display the final receipt.
My intention was to make a self scan machine similar to the ones that are used at a local grocery store all that is missing are the items that are to be called when scanned in this case I would need to add upc's for each individual item but programs works fine as intended for now.
